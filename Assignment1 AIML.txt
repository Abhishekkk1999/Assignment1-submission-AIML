Machine learning is the art of science and programming computers to learn from data , I explain this with an example like in our day to day
life we eat different things and we know which one is sweet and which is not sweet generally from our experience since childhood 
we came across to differnt things like chocolate and assume fries so its our experience that increases with respect to time ,i.e.
we gain data i.e with experiences in our mind and w.r.t time we develop accuracy with respect to that data or learn from that 
data to recognize things thier prices etc. better.
